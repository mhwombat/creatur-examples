We will create the next population in a directory called |Chapter9|.
In |main|, we initialise the |chapter9| directory, 
create two infinite gene sequences,
use those sequences to create some Bugs,
and write them to the directory.
In the previous example, the bugs in the initial population each had two identical
sequences of genetic material.
This time, however, each bug is created from two random sequences, which will usually differ.
The complete code listing is below.
