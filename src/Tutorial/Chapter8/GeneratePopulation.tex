We will create the next population in a directory called |Chapter8|.
In |main|, we initialise the |chapter8| directory, create three Bugs,
and write them to the directory.
The bugs in the initial population will each have two identical
sequences of genetic material.
(In Section \ref{sec:pop4}, we introduce a different technique for creating
an initial population, using random genetic sequences.)
The complete code listing is below.
