We will create our first population in a directory called |Chapter5|.
In |main|, we initialise the |chapter5| directory, create two rocks,
and write them to the directory.
The parameters to the |mkSimpleUniverse| command specify the name of the universe,
the path to the directory that contains it,
and the maximum number of records in a log file.
When a log file reaches the maximum size, it is closed and a new log file is started.
