We will create the next population in a directory called |chapter7|.
In |main|, we initialise the |chapter7| directory, create three 
|Plant|s, and write them to the directory.
The initial population only contains plants with red, yellow, 
or violet flowers.
Eventually, plants with orange or blue flowers might appear, but only
as the result of mutation.
(In Section \ref{sec:pop4}, we introduce a different technique for creating
an initial population, using random genetic sequences.)
The complete code listing is below.
