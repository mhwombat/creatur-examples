We will create the next population in a directory called |Chapter10|.
In |main|, we initialise the |chapter10| directory, create some rocks,
bugs, and plants, and then write them to the directory.
Since we're using |[Word8]| to encode the genome, we need to import
|BRGCWord8| instead of |BRGCBool|.
