We can re-use the implementation of |Plant| from Section \ref{sec:plant},
with a few changes.
The code that implements mating has been moved into a custom
|tryMating| function.
Again, we can drop the |run| method because
all agents will use the |run| method in \path{Tutorial.Chapter10.Martian}.
For a little variety, we'll store the genetic information as |[Word8]|
instead of |[Bool]|.
To make that change, we only need to modify the import to:

\begin{code}
import ALife.Creatur.Genetics.BRGCWord8 . . .
\end{code}

The complete code listing is below.

\includeSource{src/Tutorial/Chapter10/Plant.hs}
