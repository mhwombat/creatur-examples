We can re-use the implementation of |Plant| from Section \ref{sec:plant},
with a few changes.
The code that implements mating has been moved into a custom
|tryMating| function.
Again, we can drop the |run| method because
all agents will use the |run| method in \path{Tutorial.Example4.Martian}.

The complete code listing is below.
\includeSource{src/Tutorial/Example4/Plant.hs}
