We'll have a Martian landscape with rocks, plants, and bugs.

\begin{code}
data Martian = FromRock Rock | FromPlant Plant | FromBug Bug
  deriving (Show, Generic)
\end{code}

All agents will use the same |run| function,
which prints a log message and then 
gives the agent an opportunity to mate.

\begin{code}
run :: [Martian] -> StateT (SimpleUniverse Martian) IO [Martian]
run xs@(me:_) = do
  writeToLog $ agentId me ++ "'s turn"
  tryMating xs
run [] = error "empty agent list"
\end{code}

If the first two agents on the list are the same species,
and aren't rocks, then we call that agent's custom implementation of
|tryMating|.

\begin{code}
tryMating :: [Martian] -> StateT (SimpleUniverse Martian) IO [Martian]
tryMating (FromPlant me:FromPlant other:_) = do
    xs <- P.tryMating [me, other]
    return $ map FromPlant xs
tryMating (FromBug me:FromBug other:_) = do
    xs <- B.tryMating [me, other]
    return $ map FromBug xs
tryMating xs = return xs -- can't mate rocks or mismatched species
\end{code}
