\chapter{Overview of Créatúr}

Créatúr\footnote{\emph{Créatúr} (pronounced kray-toor) is an irish word 
meaning animal, creature, or unfortunate person.} 
is a software framework for automating experiments
with artificial life (ALife). 
It provides a daemon which ensures that each agent gets its turn 
to use the CPU. 
You can use other applications on the computer at the same time
without fear of interfering with experiments; they
will run normally (although perhaps more slowly).
Créatúr also provides a library of modules to help you implement your own 
ALife species.
Even if you aren't using the Créatúr framework, you may find some of these
modules useful.

\chapter{Getting started}
\label{sec:install}

NOTE: Créatúr uses the |hmatix| package, which requires the ``dev'' versions of the 
GSL and BLAS/LAPACK libraries.
On a Debian system, you can install these libraries with the command:

|apt-get install libgsl0-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev|.
\bigskip

The instructions below should work on Linux or OSX.
(Créatúr uses the |unix| package in order to implement the daemon.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure you've installed the Haskell platform. You can get it from
\url{http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/}.

\item At the command prompt, type |cabal install creatur|.
This will install the Créatúr framework.

\item Download |creatur-examples-master.zip| from
\url{https://github.com/mhwombat/creatur-examples/archive/master.zip}.
This contains the examples used in this tutorial.

\item Unzip the file you just downloaded (|creatur-examples-master.zip|).
This will create a directory called \path{creatur-examples-master}.

\item At the command prompt, go to the directory you just created.
(|cd creatur-examples-master|).

\item Build and install the examples by typing |cabal install|.
\end {enumerate}

If you've never used Haskell before, I recommend the following
books.
The complete content of both books is freely available online,
so try both and see which one best suits your learning style.
As suggested by the title, \emph{Real World Haskell} teaches
Haskell using a series of practical examples.
\emph{Learn You a Haskell} is presented with a great deal of humour,
and may give you a deeper understanding of functional programming
concepts.

Two good places to ask questions are 
the beginners@haskell.org mailing list
(see \url{http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mailing_lists} 
for more information)
and Stack Overflow \url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell}.

\url{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/creatur}.

\chapter{The main daemon loop}
\label{sec:daemon}

The daemon clock is a simple counter used to schedule events.
At each tick of the clock, the daemon:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Reads the current list of agents, which are stored as separate files in
the current directory.
\item Queues the agents in random order.
\item Processes the queue, giving each agent an opportunity
to use the CPU by invoking a user-supplied function.
\item Increments the daemon clock.
\end {enumerate}

A different random order is used at each clock tick
so that no agent has an unfair advantage.
(If agents were always processed in the same order, 
agents near the end of the list might, for example, find that that the 
best food has already been eaten or that the desirable mating
partners are already taken.)

\chapter{Overview of the process}

The steps for using Créatúr to create and run an ALife experiment
are listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create one or more ALife species
\item Generate an initial population
\item Configure a daemon
\item Build and run the universe
\end {enumerate}

\chapter{A very simple species}
\label{sec:rock}

In this part of the tutorial, we create and run a universe
with a very simple species.
This will introduce you to the basics of the Créatúr framework.

\section{Create a species}
\label{sec:species1}

\input{src/Tutorial/Chapter5/Rock.tex}

\section{Generate an initial population}
\label{sec:pop1}

\input{src/Tutorial/Chapter5/GeneratePopulation.tex}

The procedure for running this program will be described in Section 
\ref{sec:run1}.

\section{Configure a daemon}
\label{sec:daemon1}

\input{src/Tutorial/Chapter5/Daemon.tex}

\section{Build and run the example}
\label{sec:run1}


Here is the listing of |creatur-examples.cabal|.
\verbatiminput{creatur-examples.cabal}

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you haven't already done so, follow the instructions in Chapter
\ref{sec:install}.
\item Create the initial population by running |chapter5-init|.
\item Start the daemon with the command |sudo chapter5-daemon start|.
\item Stop the daemon with the command |sudo chapter5-daemon stop|.
(Stopping the daemon may take a few seconds.)
\end{enumerate}

Log messages are sent to |chapter5/log/Chapter5.log|.
Examine that file and notice that the counter is counting up for both rocks.
If you stop the daemon and restart it, it will pick up where it left off
\footnote{When the stop command is received, the daemon will attempt
to finish the processing for the current clock tick.
Depending on the processor speed and the number of agents in the population,
it may not finish before the hard kill which is issued three seconds later.
The database or file system is not updated until an agent's turn at the CPU 
is complete, so any partial results are discarded.
If the daemon terminates while an agent is running,
the effect is that the current agent, and all others after it in the queue,
miss their turn at the CPU.
However, even frequent restarting of the daemon
is unlikely to cause CPU starvation for any particular agent.
The random order in which agents are processed spreads the impact
over the population.}, preserving the value of the 
counter between runs.

A sample extract from the log file is shown below.
The first field is the system clock time.
The second field is the daemon clock time.
The third field is the log message.
Note that in clock tick |0|, |Rocky| gets to use the CPU before |Rocky|,
while in clock tick |3|, |Roxie| goes first.
This demonstrates the randomisation discussed in section \ref{sec:daemon}.

\begin{verbatim}
130121121233+0000       Starting
130121121233+0000       0       Rocky's counter is 42
130121121233+0000       0       Roxie's counter is 99
130121121233+0000       1       Rocky's counter is 43
130121121233+0000       1       Roxie's counter is 100
130121121233+0000       2       Roxie's counter is 101
130121121233+0000       2       Rocky's counter is 44
130121121233+0000       3       Roxie's counter is 102
130121121233+0000       3       Rocky's counter is 45
130121121234+0000       4       Rocky's counter is 46
130121121234+0000       4       Roxie's counter is 103
\end{verbatim}

\section{Key points}

\begin{itemize}
\item Any species used in the Créatúr framework must be an instance of |ALife.Creatur.Agent|
and |Serialize|.
Normally the species should also be an instance of |ALife.Creatur.Database.Record|.
\item It is generally not necessary to write an implementation of |Serialize|.
Instead, add |deriving Generic| to the declaration,
and declare |instance Serialize MyClass|.
\item Consult the haddock documentation (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/creatur)
for more detailed information about the API.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Recombination}
\label{sec:recombination}

When agents that reproduce, the offspring will inherit a mixture of
genetic information from both parents.
Here are two scenarios that could be used, although there are other
possibilities.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Your agents use \emph{asexual} reproduction.
Each agent has a \emph{single} sequence of genetic information.
When two agents mate, their genes are shuffled to produce
two \emph{new} sequences.
You can create two children from these sequences,
or discard one sequence and create a child with the remaining sequence.
\item Your agents use \emph{sexual} reproduction.
Each agent has \emph{two} sequences of genetic information.
When two agents mate, each agent contributes \emph{one}
sequence to the child.
A parent's two sequences are shuffled to produce two \emph{new}
sequences.
One of the sequences is discarded; the other sequence becomes
that parent's contribution to the child's genome.
The same process occurs with the other parent's genome.
The two sequences (one from each parent) are combined to create the 
child's genome.
This is analogous to the production of a \emph{gamete} (ovum or sperm) 
in biology.
\end{enumerate}

Both scenarios involve shuffling a pair of sequences to produce two new
pairs, and possibly discarding one of the sequences.
In addition, you may wish to allow occasional random mutations.
The Créatúr framework provides the 
several operations for this purpose, in the
\path{ALife.Creatur.Genetics.Recombination} package.
These operations can be applied (multiple times)
with specified probabilities
and combined in various ways.
Two common operations, \emph{crossover} and \emph{cut-and-splice},
are illustrated below.
In crossover, a single crossover point is chosen.
All data beyond that point is swapped between strings.
In cut-and-splice, two points are chosen, one on each string.
This generally results in two strings of unequal length.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.7,keepaspectratio=true]{./images/crossover.eps}
  \caption{Crossover}
  \label{fig:crossover}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.7,keepaspectratio=true]{./images/cut-and-splice.eps}
  \caption{Cut-and-splice}
  \label{fig:cut-and-splice}
\end{figure}

Here's a sample program that might be used to shuffle two
sequences of genetic material.

\label{code:recombination}
\begin{code}
    withProbability 0.1 randomCrossover (xs, ys) >>=
    withProbability 0.01 randomCutAndSplice >>=
    withProbability 0.001 mutatePairedLists >>=
    randomOneOfPair
\end{code} 

To understand how this program works,
let's walk through a simple example.
Suppose this program acted on the following pair of sequences:
\begin{code}
([A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],[C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C])
\end{code} 
The |randomCrossover| function \emph{might} perform a simple crossover,
perhaps resulting in:
\begin{code}
([A,A,A,A,A,A,A,C,C,C],[C,C,C,C,C,C,C,A,A,A])
\end{code} 
The|randomCutAndSplice| function \emph{might} then perform a cut-and-splice, perhaps
resulting in:
\begin{code}
([A,A,A,A,C,A,A,A],[C,C,C,C,C,C,A,A,A,C,C,C])
\end{code} 
The |mutatePairedLists| function \emph{might} then mutate one or both sequences, perhaps
resulting in
\begin{code}
([T,A,A,A,C,A,A,A],[C,C,C,C,C,C,A,A,C,C,C,C])
\end{code} 
The numbers 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 control the likelihood of each
of the three operations occurring.
After the first three operations, we have two new sequences.
In this example, we only want one of the sequences,
so the final line randomly chooses one.

To perform more than one crossover, the operation can simply be repeated
as shown below.

\begin{code}
    withProbability 0.1 randomCrossover (xs, ys) >>=
    withProbability 0.08 randomCrossover (xs, ys) >>=
    . . .
\end{code} 

Alternatively, we can choose the number of crossover operations at 
random. The function |repeatWithProbability| performs an operation a
random number of times, such that the probability of repeating the
operation |n| times is $p^n$.

\begin{code}
    repeatWithProbability 0.1 randomCrossover (xs, ys) >>=
    . . .
\end{code} 

Other recombination operators are also available.
Consult the documentation of \path{ALife.Creatur.Genetics.Recombination}
for more information.

\chapter{Asexual reproduction}
\label{sec:plant}

In this part of the tutorial, we create a species with the
ability to reproduce asexually.

\section{Create a species}
\label{sec:species2}

\input{src/Tutorial/Chapter7/Plant.tex}

\section{Generate an initial population}
\label{sec:pop2}

\input{src/Tutorial/Chapter7/GeneratePopulation.tex}

\section{Configure a daemon}
\label{sec:daemon2}

\input{src/Tutorial/Chapter7/Daemon.tex}

\section{Build and run the example}
\label{sec:run2}

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you haven't already done so, follow the instructions in Chapter 
\ref{sec:install}.
\item Create the initial population by running |chapter7-init|.
\item Start/stop/restart the daemon with the command
\UndefineShortVerb{\|}
\DefineShortVerb{\+}
+sudo chapter7-daemon start|stop|restart+.
\UndefineShortVerb{\+}
\DefineShortVerb{\|}
(Stopping the daemon may take a few seconds.)
\end{enumerate}

Log messages are sent to |chapter7/log/Chapter7.log|.

A sample extract from the log file is shown below.
To conserve space, the timestamps have been omitted.
From this, you can see that the first mating (between |Rose| and |Sunny|)
occurs at time 0.
The offspring, |Chapter7_1|, gets its first CPU turn at time 1.

\begin{verbatim}
Starting
0       Vi and Rose gave birth to Chapter7_1, with Red flowers
0       Rose and Vi gave birth to Chapter7_2, with Violet flowers
0       Sunny and Rose gave birth to Chapter7_3, with Red flowers
1       Chapter7_1 and Sunny gave birth to Chapter7_4, with Yellow flowers
1       Rose and Vi gave birth to Chapter7_5, with Violet flowers
1       Chapter7_3 and Chapter7_2 gave birth to Chapter7_6, with Red flowers
1       Chapter7_2 and Sunny gave birth to Chapter7_7, with Violet flowers
1       Vi and Chapter7_7 gave birth to Chapter7_8, with Violet flowers
1       Sunny and Chapter7_8 gave birth to Chapter7_9, with Yellow flowers
2       Chapter7_4 and Rose gave birth to Chapter7_10, with Yellow flowers
2       Chapter7_7 and Chapter7_6 gave birth to Chapter7_11, with Violet flowers
2       Chapter7_6 and Rose gave birth to Chapter7_12, with Red flowers
2       Chapter7_5 and Chapter7_10 gave birth to Chapter7_13, with Violet flowers
2       Chapter7_3 and Chapter7_7 gave birth to Chapter7_14, with Red flowers
2       Chapter7_8 and Chapter7_14 gave birth to Chapter7_15, with Red flowers
2       Rose and Chapter7_14 gave birth to Chapter7_16, with Red flowers
2       Sunny and Chapter7_12 gave birth to Chapter7_17, with Yellow flowers
2       Vi and Chapter7_5 gave birth to Chapter7_18, with Violet flowers
\end{verbatim}

\section{Key points}

\begin{itemize}
\item A species that reproduces should be an instance of the |Genetic| class in
one of the |ALife.Creatur.Genetics.Code.*| modules,
e.g., |ALife.Creatur.Genetics.Code.BRGCBool|.
\item It is generally not necessary to write an implementation of |Genetic|.
Instead, add |deriving Generic| to the declaration,
and declare |instance Genetic MyClass|.
\item In order for a type to use a generic implementation for a class such as
|Serialize| or |Genetic|, any type that it ``contains'' must also be an instance of that class.
\item Encoding genetic information using a Gray code helps to ensure that offspring
are similar to their parents (unless a mutation occurs).
\item The module |ALife.Creatur.Genetics.Recombination| provides functions
for controlling how the genes of the parents are shuffled to produce the child's genome.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Sexual reproduction}
\label{sec:bug}

In this part of the tutorial, we create a species with the
ability to reproduce sexually.

\section{Key points}

\begin{itemize}
\item A species that reproduces \emph{sexually} should be an instance of
|Diploid| (as well as |Genetic|).
\item It is generally not necessary to write an implementation of |Diploid|.
Instead, add |deriving Generic| to the declaration,
and declare |instance Diploid MyClass|.
\item The generic implementation of |Diploid| chooses the ``smaller'' of two values.
For types with multiple constructors, this means that constructors that appear
earlier in the definition are dominant over those that
appear later.
\item The list of agents returned by the ``run'' method only needs to contain agents that
have been modified.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Generating a random initial population}

(Stopping the daemon may take a few seconds.)
\end{enumerate}

Log messages are sent to |chapter9/log/Chapter10.log|.

\section{Key points}

\begin{itemize}
\item To create a species for which the initial population can be randomly generated,
add a parameter to the ``build'' method that controls whether the gene sequence is truncated.
\item When creating the initial population, use truncation.
Thereafter, turn truncation off.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Working with multiple species}

\item If you haven't already done so, follow the instructions in Chapter 
\ref{sec:install}.
\item Create the initial population by running |chapter10-init|.
\item Start/stop/restart the daemon with the command
\UndefineShortVerb{\|}
\DefineShortVerb{\+}
+sudo chapter10-daemon start|stop|restart+.
\UndefineShortVerb{\+}
\DefineShortVerb{\|}
(Stopping the daemon may take a few seconds.)
\end{enumerate}

Log messages are sent to |chapter10/log/Chapter10.log|.

\section{Key points}

\begin{itemize}
\item To work with multiple species, where each species is a different Haskell type,
unify the types with a ``container'' type (e.g., the |Martian| class).
\end{itemize}

Frequently Anticipated Questions

Q: What is the structure of the universe directory?

A: See the example below.

\begin{code}
chapter9
chapter9/db
chapter9/db/Flo            -- contains the agent named ``Flo''
chapter9/db/Bugsy          -- contains the agent named ``Bugsy''
chapter9/db/Chapter9_16    -- contains the agent named ``Chapter9_16''
. . .
chapter9/namer             -- contains a counter for generating names
chapter9/log
chapter9/log/Chapter9.log  -- the current log file
                           -- there may be older log files as well
chapter9/log/Chapter9.exp  -- contains a counter for log rotation
chapter9/clock             -- contains the current ``universe'' time
\end{code}

Q: How can I write tools (apart from the daemon) that operate on the agents.

A: See \path{Tutorial/Chapter9/Examine.hs} for an example of a simple analysis tool.
That program uses |agentIds| and |getAgent| to read the agents from the
population, without modifying them.
You can also work with agents that have ``died'' and been archived,
using |archivedAgentIds| and |getAgentFromArchive|.

Alternatively, you can read the agent files directly, as shown below.
Be careful not to modify a file while the daemon is running.

\begin{code}
ghci> :l Tutorial.Chapter9.Bug
[1 of 1] Compiling Tutorial.Chapter9.Bug ( src/Tutorial/Chapter9/Bug.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Tutorial.Chapter9.Bug.
ghci> import Data.Serialize
ghci> import Data.ByteString
ghci> x <- BS.readFile "chapter9/db/Bugsy"
ghci> let b = decode x :: Either String Bug
ghci> b
Right (Bug {bugName = "Bugsy", bugColour = Green, bugSpots = [], bugSex = Female,
bugEnergy = 6, bugGenome = ([False,True,False,True,False],[True,True,True,False])})
\end{code}

Q: What causes this (or a similar) error message?
\begin{code}
    No instance for (ALife.Creatur.Genetics.Code.BRGCWord8.GGene
                       (GHC.Generics.Rep ClassifierGene))
      arising from a use of `ALife.Creatur.Genetics.Code.BRGCWord8.$gdmput'
\end{code}

A: Did you remember to add |deriving Generic| to your gene type?

\chapter{TO DO}
\textit{Some things I'd like to do to enhance this tutorial...}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain that if you don't want the child to be immediately mature
and able to interact with other agents and mate,
you could keep it as a field in the mother's implementation
until it's mature.
Include an example.

\item Show how to collect statistics.

\item Show how to keep agents and logs in a database rather than as separate
files. I'm thinking of providing an "agent interface" to MongoDB and any
ODBC-compliant DB.

\item Show how to get a list of agents meeting certain criteria 
(e.g. all agents within a certain distance of a particular agent).
This will require a different DB.

\item Show how to add other state data to the universe (in addition to
the clock, logger, agent namer, and database).
\end{enumerate}
